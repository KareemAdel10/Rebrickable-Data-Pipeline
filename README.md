# Rebrickable Data Ingestion Pipeline
---
The **Rebrickable Data Pipeline project** is a comprehensive data ingestion system designed to securely ingest and process data from two distinct sources: **the Rebrickable LEGO Database** and **the Rebrickable User Database**.
This project leverages Azure Data Factory (ADF) to build and manage separate pipelines for each database, ensuring secure access control, daily automation, environment synchronization, and failure alerting.
# Project Goals
---
The primary objective is to establish a robust pipeline architecture to ingest, transform, and store data from **Rebrickableâ€™s APIs** while maintaining strict security standards and operational efficiency.

- **Data Source**:
    - zipped files from Reprickable
- **Data Storage**:
    - Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 that stores raw.
- **Data Processing**:
    - Azure Data Factory:
        ADF is used to create an ingestion pipeline.
- **Data Exploration**:
    - Azure Storage Explorer is used to interact with Azure Blob Storage and ADLS Gen2.

# Steps
---
1. **Environment planning**:
    - Create two resource groups in Azure, one is for the **development** environment and the other is for the **production** environment, create an instance of **ADF** and **ADLSg2** for each environment.
2. **Security**:
    - create three groups using **Microsoft Entra ID**:
        1. **adlsg2deployment** and **RBAC** for the deployment and the development environment. both are used to give **storage blob data contributor** role on the ADLSg2 accounts to each corresponding ADF instance.

        2. **DEV+PROD** a group that gives access for both adf instances to a single key vault that has the secrets on which the pipeline depend.
