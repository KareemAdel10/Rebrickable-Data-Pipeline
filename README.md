# Rebrickable Data Ingestion Pipeline
---
The **Rebrickable Data Pipeline project** is a comprehensive data ingestion system designed to securely ingest and process data from two distinct sources: **the Rebrickable LEGO Database** and **the Rebrickable User Database**.
This project leverages Azure Data Factory (ADF) to build and manage separate pipelines for each database, ensuring secure access control, daily automation, environment synchronization, and failure alerting.
# Project Goals
---
The primary objective is to establish a robust pipeline architecture to ingest, transform, and store data from **Rebrickableâ€™s APIs** while maintaining strict security standards and operational efficiency.
